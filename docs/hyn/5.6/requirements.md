## Experience

In case you are new to Laravel we urge you to get familiar with that
before jumping into building something with this package. Having built
at least one project with the framework (for fun) makes it much easier
grasping the concepts at hand.

The following resources we recommend:

- [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs)
- [Laravel from scratch free series at Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2017)
