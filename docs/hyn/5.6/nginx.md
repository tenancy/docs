# Set up

You need to set up your own PHP FPM. The preferred way of running php is through a [socket][setup-socket] by
configuring the `listen` value in your pool correctly. Make sure to copy the path of your
sock and update your `webserver.php` configuration file to reflect that value, for instance:

```php
    /**
     * Nginx webserver support.
     *
     * @see http://nginx.org
     */
    'nginx' => [
        // ..

        /**
         * The php sock to be used.
         */
        'php-sock' => 'unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock',
        
        // ..
    ],
```

# Configuration

Tenancy natively integrates with the Nginx webserver. For that to work you need
to do a minor configuration.

Edit the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and below the last `include` statement
add:

```apacheconfig
include <path>/*.conf;
```

Where `<path>` has to be replaced by the location of your vhost files generated by this package.

> Your vhost files are saved by default inside the `storage/app/tenancy/webserver/nginx` and
can be reconfigured in the `webserver.php` configuration file.

Make sure to restart nginx afterwards:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
