Laravel Tenancy is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, 
the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project 
is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support development
via the following methods:

## Open Collective

Our Open Collective offers one-time and recurring pledges. Open Collective works as our
fiscal sponsor, is heavily vested in promoting sustainable open source financing and
does so by allowing transparent use of collective funds.

- [Choose your tier](https://opencollective.com/tenancy). Tiers are required to become a sponsor and be listed on our website.
- [One time or freely configurable pledge](https://opencollective.com/tenancy/donate).

## Developers

You can also choose to back each of our developers separately. On our [homepage](/) you will find a
team roster. Team members you can support have an orange Patreon or GitHub button.
